snake-for-arduino
=================

A snake (video game) for Arduino with a 160x128 TFT-screen and a joystick shield.
It's in a early development state and therefore contains mutch uncommented (and maybe unnecessary) code. Intructions will be released as soon as it's working and ready to use. There are plans on rewriting it with some OOP.
